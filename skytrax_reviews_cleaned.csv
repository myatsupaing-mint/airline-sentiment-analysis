'they never give us enough food. it's mad. they give us 6 sandwiches for the whole flight'. needless to say that ba can no longer live on their past reputation. they had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the low-cost carriers. sadly, they probably sit about 4th or 5th down the list. i'd say i'd give their long-haul a chance but after this experience, i won't bother. what a shame.",Business,Economy Class,Miami to London,2017-01-01,no,Boeing 747

flying in club europe from london city to berlin tegel, returning in economy with british airways. the outbound flight was delayed for nearly 1 hour. however, the journey itself was very smooth and enjoyable. the food offered in the ce cabin was delicious. flying back in economy was an absolute nightmare. everything went wrong from checking in, lounge access, baggage claim and extremely poor service relating to my missing luggage. i had done my online check in on my return flight. just went to the check in counter to drop off my luggage. the check in agent offered me a paper boarding pass which later i discovered had been incorrectly issued to me. she checked me in under someone else who happens to have the same last name as mine. after i dropped off my luggage, i went to the business lounge as i am a silver member. i provided the recepitionist my paper boarding pass and entrance was declined. not surprising given the fact that they gave me the wrong boarding pass. however, i showed the receptionist my silver status on my mobile app. she didn't even look at it and told me my membership had been downgraded on her system. she didn't investigate anything and asked me to call up ba which i didn't bother. when i was queuing up at the passport control, i noticed the destination shown on my boarding pass was incorrect. i approached the ba staff at the gate immediately after i had cleared through security. ba staff were shocked that i was checked in under someone else's name. wrong name, wrong flight etc. they asked me to go to the correct gate immediately, but then they also told me my checked luggage was on the wrong flight and i might not have it back upon arrival at lcy. they gave me a new luggage tag. after arriving at lcy, waited for 20mins, bag didn't show up. i approached the baggage claim agent who was on her phone. i explained the situation which she didn't really pay attention and asked me to stand next to the conveyor belt, insisting my luggage would arrive. again, no investigation, rushed service and a bit rude. 3 days later - no luggage still despite the fact that they have located my luggage.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to BKK,2016-06-01,no,Boeing 777

British Airways customer review,2,Michael Stanley,2015-05-31,ba 10 bangkok to london heathrow may 26th 2015 world traveller plus (premium economy). first the positives: check-in at bkk was reasonably efficient the flight departed on time and landed at lhr about 15 minutes early. unfortunately while world traveller plus provides some extra leg room when compared to economy there was nothing else about our flight experience that justified the additional cost of world traveller plus. the cabin seating and equipment were tired - the entertainment system was old and barely functional. however by far the worst aspect of the flight was the poor service from the cabin crew who almost without exception appeared uninterested in customer service to the point of rudeness. their strategy seemed to be to minimise their exposure to customers in order to maximise the time they could spend in the galley at the rear of the aircraft. after the first meal service (an uninspiring chicken curry with boiled to death broccoli and carrot not remotely resembling the misleadingly optimistic descriptions found on the ba website about the supposed 'enhanced' dining experience of world traveller plus) calls for service went unanswered for lengthy periods of time. it seemed the only effective way to obtain further service was to walk to the rear galley where staff congregated and made it clear they did not appreciate being 'interrupted' barely acknowledging requests while continuing their conversation and grudgingly fulfilling requests to a bare minimum. in stark contrast to the excellent cabin service food and entertainment options we experienced flying in economy on qantas to bangkok the previous day this so called 'premium' experience on ba was extremely disappointing. our advice: don't waste your money on ba world traveller plus.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Unknown,,yes,Unknown
British Airways customer review,7,K Jackson,2015-05-27,lgw-cun-lgw. husband and i had middle seats both outbound and return. we found seats comfortable for seating and sleeping. crew on outbound were a lot more efficient and friendlier than the inbound crew where the service was a bit haphazard and one particular crew member who was a few years older than the others was rather offhand and didn't smile much at all. outboard there were empty seats all around us so we did not have to sit face to face with strangers or climb over anyone when leaving our seats but cabin was quite full inboard so we did not enjoy the flight as much. the club world cabin is definitely cramped compared with other business class cabins and i do not know what ba were thinking when they decided to pack in so many seats and in such a way as to make it very awkward for less mobile passengers to exit their seats. storage space is lacking around the seats due to ba trying to fit too many passengers into too small a space. i would not say i would not travel club world with ba again but would look at alternative airlines with different cabin layouts first.,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Unknown,,yes,Unknown

(the wife was driving on arrival) the fas were great. friendly and treated us like customers - not like cattle. funnily enough both flights pushed back early and arrived early. flight home was a bit rough due to high winds around pisa - and a re-assuring comment over the pa system was a thoughtful touch to nervous flyers - my wife included. all in all ba at its best. they either getting it right or spectacularly wrong. there never appears to be anything in the middle. am flying again with them in 4 weeks time and look forward to it.,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Unknown,,no,Unknown

British Airways customer review,4,C Childs,2015-03-04,my return flight from cape town to heathrow ba0042 30/1/15 was a miserable experience. my entertainment system was not available for three hours despite being told that it could easily be re-set. (no one was available to do it). when it did become available it was lights-out time and my seat would not recline. it was not possible to focus on the screen with the reclined seat in front at such close quarters. two stewardesses thought the seat belt was preventing the seat from reclining but when this was not the reason no one else came to investigate. no one seemed to care that i needed to stand for long periods to relieve my back. being polite and patient did me no good. i have several questions. how often are the seats serviced? why is the entertainment system so unreliable? how often are the seat belts checked because mine kept slipping? customer services want me to chose ba in the future but as they ignored addressing these issues when i wrote to them i have too many doubts.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Unknown,,yes,Unknown

British Airways customer review,1,V Pervaaz,2015-02-11,"i have been a loyal customer for the last 10 years and have progressively seen the service cleanliness and interest in client satisfaction decline. i just came back from a nyc-lhr-dubai trip and will not fly ba again. several reasons: my seat in business class was noticeably filthy - crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow. when i told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away. i was hounded for not filling out the breakfast form in 5 minutes (the plane had not even taken off) and told that ""i would not get breakfast"". i was served raw chicken and when i expressed interest in another dish was told that all the other passengers had eaten and that there were no more dishes on the plane? the dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies - not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that i was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight. perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with ba is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are doing you a favor. as a customer paying nearly 10000 usd for a round trip ticket i shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked. the seats on two of the legs were broken and my screen did not work on three of the legs. there are plenty of other first class carriers out there that i will now become a customer of.",Solo Leisure,First Class,Unknown,,yes,Unknown
British Airways customer review,2,Charles Green,2015-01-28,return flight from lhr t5 to washington dulles (iad) in club world. check in was fine even if the layout of the t5 check-in area isn't the most intuitive. security was efficient. however the ba lounge was overcrowded and noisy with minimal service and only basic comforts. outbound flight on the a380. boarding was rather chaotic due to the gate area being too small for such a large passenger compliment but the flight did push back on-time. the club world cabin on the upper deck could best be described as grey and functional. it was reasonably clean if not spotless but despite being a relatively new aircraft it did feel slightly shabby already. the club world seat which was forward facing and on the aisle was comfortable enough. the entertainment screen was rather small and the choice of movies wasn't terribly extensive but everything apart from the in-seat usb power socket was working. the general layout of the cabin was terrible. not only do window seat and middle row passengers have to step over the legs of aisle seat passengers to get to and from their seats but when the privacy screen between seats is lowered for take-off landing and during meal services you find yourself staring rather disconcertingly close up into your neighbours face. it makes everything feel cramped and cheap. meals were fine and the crew were polite and efficient. overall i'd rate the outbound experience as 'okay' for a business class flight. return flight experience was far from okay. my flight departing iad at 10.20 pm was cancelled 6 hours prior to departure due to mechanical issues. told that there were no club world seats on the earlier flight out of iad that night which i could just about make at a push and i would have to fly back in economy. when i asked about the ba flight from baltimore (bwi) an hour later i was told that yes there were club world seats available that evening so i asked to be rebooked onto that flight instead. arriving at bwi check-in i was informed that unfortunately there actually weren't any club world seats available and i would have to fly back in world traveller plus. the flight from bwi to lhr t5 was on a rather old 767. the cabin interior was dated shabby and cramped with minimal overhead luggage storage. world traveller plus seats were cramped and uncomfortable with tiny entertainment screens. in-flight food was bland. the crew were efficient but not terribly friendly. flight left and arrived on time. as a uk passport holder immigration at t5 was quick. baggage reclaim took longer but bags arrived within five minutes of reaching the baggage hall.,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Unknown,,yes,Unknown

British Airways customer review,7,S Morley,2015-01-19,washington (iad) to heathrow on christmas day returning january 5th. i find myself nodding in agreement to many of the reviews written here by other passengers regarding the slippage in standards of ba especially considering what they once were. having arrived at dulles in good time to check in there were paper notices on the desk to say that check in would not open 'til 5.00 pm. okay it was christmas day but all other carriers both domestic and international were open (the airport was busy) and i along with other passengers had to sit and wait for 1.5 hrs until staff arrived. the same was true of the lounge which having made it through security was not open 'til 6.30 pm. again the other airline lounges were open. having eventually gained access the lounge was great and the bar and dinner service (i was on a sleeper flight) were very good with plentiful drinks and fine food. we boarded on time and my seat was upstairs on the a380. this aircraft is of course huge but the club world seat is as many have noted much less comfortable than the boeing 777 or 747. it is narrower and whilst okay for seating very hard and difficult to find the right position for sleeping. ba seem to have missed a great opportunity here to do something really special along the lines of some of the asian carriers. the crew were very good - friendly and attentive. breakfast before we landed was very average. the bacon rolls were dried out and are always a challenge to eat. yoghurt and fruit were the alternatives which i went for. check in for the return journey was lamentable at heathrow terminal 5. dedicated club world positions had queues around ten people deep and moved terribly slowly. not all the positions were open and passengers were visibly irritated. the journey other than the cramped seat issue again was fine with another good crew and food and drinks. i have always recommended ba to friends and would like to keep doing so but feel that especially given the high and rising cost of paying for club these days ba need to adopt a slightly less 'take' attitude and give a little more especially when it comes to spending avios which they are very keen for one to accrue but reticent to allow one to use.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Unknown,,yes,Unknown

British Airways customer review,10,Suhail Shafi,2014-10-22,i recently flew on british airways long haul on a flight from philadelphia to new delhi havinh not having travelled with british airway for around a decade. i had been a huge fan of british airways in the past and was very curious to see how their inflight product and entertainment had changed in that time. i also was curious to see heathrow's new terminal 5. british airway's overall product has improved in that time. on the first leg from philadelphia to london i was very happy to notice the new seats with excellent comfort with adjustable headrests and new audio video on demand (avod) entertainment systems. i had been travelling with noise cancelling headphones which made the experience a thoroughly enjoyable one. inflight entertainment system is sophisticated and i enjoyed their world music section in particular. the asian vegetarian meals was of a high standard for the most part. my only criticism in this area was that on the second meal (breakfast) we only were served a fruit platter and had to ask for the croissants everyone else were given. in addition i found the chapatis on the delhi-london sector to be hard as rocks. otherwise the meals were very good. terminal 5 is a gem of an airport but the true highlight of the journey was on the london-philadelphia sector when i had the opportunity to fly on the dreamliner. the plane is a marvel. the windows are huge dimmable by button too. the bathrooms are larger than usual and the flight was very smooth. additionally the legroom on the dreamliner is impressive - an improvement on the b777. and finally a word about the cabin attendants. their level of friendliness varies from person to person but for the most part they represent the best traditions of british hospitality - informal politeness. all in all i was happy with my ba trip and they continue to perform as one of my favourite airlines.,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Unknown,,yes,Unknown

British Airways customer review,8,Mark Williams,2014-09-18,flew lhr-bud 11 sep ba866 and return 15 sep ba 869 club europe. early morning flight from t3 so breakfast in lounge. usual assortment of cereals and fruit etc but limited selection of hot food (although the bacon roll was delicious). as is usually the case had to ask for champagne but staff happy to oblige and quickly brought it to our table. plenty of staff around and the whole lounge appeared to be kept tidy and clean. had to board via a bus and there was no preference given to business passengers. managed to get onto the bus first and got to seat without any problem. plane had been refitted with the new layout. beautiful cabin and the seats are lovely but gone is the extra leg room in club. big disappointment. it feels quite claustrophobic and then the person in front puts their seat back. not as nice a place to be compared to the old club section aesthetics notwithstanding. friendly crew plenty of champagne and a surprisingly good hot breakfast of omelette mushrooms bacon and sausage with hot bread. coffee still poor however. no ife apart from progress maps / information on small screen from ceiling. bud airport a disaster. no time at all to clear immigration but had to wait almost an hour for bags - priority tags didn't seem to make any difference. no aircon in bag collection and overcrowded with people waiting for bags. very uncomfortable and unpleasant. on return the lounge ba shares at bud is small with very limited selection of food and drinks but all quite acceptable. a short delay was posted at check in and gate changed but all in all no real problem. priority boarding worked well. same plane configuration on return. excellent crew up front on return too - plenty of smiles and chat. fas free with the booze and nuts. food was again a surprise - i had cod with a tandoori sauce and rice with cauliflower. very tasty. ba can be hit and miss but i thoroughly enjoyed both flights. a great soft product if they can maintain the standard but the new fit out is a disappointment.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Unknown,,yes,Unknown
British Airways customer review,9,D Morgan,2014-09-14,lhr-edi used avios to make short break to edinburgh. unlike transatlantic flights there were plenty of seats on offer even at short notice and we managed to get onto the flights we wanted. both flights were on time (more or less) and both were on new a320 aircraft - bright and airy interiors with plenty of storage space for luggage. the drink and small bag of nuts while welcome is nothing to get excited about and seems more of a gimmick these days to distance ba from its budget airline rivals. service levels both on the plane and on the ground were excellent throughout and i really enjoyed this domestic service.,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Unknown,,yes,Unknown
British Airways customer review,7,J Tydeman,2014-09-09,flew heathrow to lyon return. late flight on the way out but made up all but 10 mins of the time. catering hardly worth the effort as comprised unappetising looking sandwich and one drink (not even tea or coffee on the outbound). crew good and check in very good especially at heathrow.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Unknown,,no,Unknown
British Airways customer review,6,Mohamedali Maz,2014-09-06,travelled lhr to montreal 21st august 2014 and montreal to lhr 1st september 2014. aircraft used was a 777-200 with 4 classes. this sector does not normally offer a first service so business class passengers were spread throughout the first and club world cabins. all flights were on time and the cabin crew were excellent especially on the outward leg. check in and baggage reclaim were smooth and efficient. the lounges at terminal 5 are looking tired and were rather dirty when we used them. food choice was limited although i did enjoy the hot soup. seating in ba is dated and even ba's new first class seat is rather disappointing when compared to even business class on carries such as emirates or qatar. food is well below par both in terms of quality and quantity. i know ba is struggling to make ends meet but ultimately it has to appreciate that people paying for premium cabins expect a certain experience and the seat and food make up a major element of that experience. i guess there is little competition for ba on the north atlantic routes but it helps to explain why their share of routes to the far east and australia are diminishing.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Unknown,,no,Unknown
British Airways customer review,6,Russ King,2014-09-01,ba15 lhr to sin b777-300er first class: nice a (four months old) but a few signs of wear already. the seat (2k) was reasonably private and reasonably quiet. useful wardrobe with enough space to put various items and shoes but the seat has almost no other storage space. things have to be left loose in the foot-well area. footrest doubles as a buddy seat although his would be rather cramped i'd imagine. seat itself fine and comfortable. good enough to get reasonable sleep on a 12hr journey. cabin lighting and temperature perfect. view of outside restricted by the angle of the seat - just when it is interesting (t/off and landing) you are strapped in and cannot see all the fun outside - the child in me i guess! food and service excellent. the toilets - wow - a flimsy concertina door poor water supply into small bowl so not really good for brushing teeth. middle-eastern airlines are so much better - ba really has to re-think. overall ba first class is equivalent to others business class. cabin crew very attentive - if only they had a better product to work with.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Unknown,,yes,Unknown
British Airways customer review,4,A Razak,2014-08-28,ba12 15th august 2014. in my mind that when i bought the ba tickets it would be a great flight experience based on their reputation as a 4 star airline. it turned out to be totally wrong. i used to travel with other airlines it seems that my flight experience with ba from changi airport to heathrow was the worst in so many ways. not worth money spent at all! firstly the seat space was really small (i cant imagine those who are bigger than i am because i am a medium size person). secondly the proportion of food served was not generous in comparison to other airlines. they only served food twice for that 12 hour long haul journey. thirdly the service was considered moderate and it seemed like no one cared about the toilets in economy class (no one bothered to top up the toilet rolls). lastly the inflight entertainment was so back dated. the movies selection must have been 2 years old. flimsy earphones and outdated screens. all in all an unhappy customer.,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Unknown,,no,Unknown
British Airways customer review,1,Jill Young,2014-08-26,we paid £2500 to upgrade to world traveller plus when we got to departure lounge we were upgraded to business class which was brilliant but air hostess made a point of letting us known plus other people that we had a free upgrade. on the return journey in world traveller plus not happy table broken and air steward very sarcastic food very bad plus stewards seemed as if they were doing you a favour. paid a lot of money to fly to maldives have no choice to fly ba to go direct stewards male or female need to remember that we are customers paying a lot of money for a service.,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Unknown,,yes,Unknown

British Airways customer review,7,Holder Timothy,2014-08-02,upgraded from premium economy to business from yvr (vancouver) to lhr (london). the club world cabin was full and a couple of the passengers had been upgraded to first. despite this the staff were friendly and helpful although the food wasn't that great (the chocolate desert was delicious though). seat is nice and wide but if you're facing rearwards on the 747 you could be sitting right next to someone you don't know. the ife had a lot of choice and had many new movies to chose from. altogether a good flight.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Unknown,,yes,Unknown

British Airways customer review,10,Jackie Craig,2014-07-15,i flew with british airways with my mother from paphos to manchester. she had a fit to fly certificate that stated that she needed room to turn as she had recently broken her hip. i was told at the airport that there were no seats at the front available so she had to go into the second row and had to shuffle in sideways which was very painful and distressing for her. then the 3 seats in front of her where she could have had room to turn were occupied by 3 able-bodied men! i think this is total disregard for passenger welfare. i will never fly with ba again.,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Unknown,,yes,Unknown

British Airways customer review,5,C Denson,2014-06-30,london lhr to hong kong on 27 may. was really looking forward to flying in the new a380 but for some reason the plane was swapped on the day for a b777. flight left about 25 minutes late but arrived 20 minutes early into hk. on boarding i agreed to swap seats with a woman who had been seated separately from her husband. having ordered a vegetarian meal i let one of the cabin crew know that i'd swapped seats. when the meal was served i got told off very rudely by one of the cabin crew for moving seats without telling them - even though i had. before i could explain my meal was dumped in my lap and he flounced off. food was ok. cabin crew smiles were forced. serve the meal turn out the lights and disappear for 9 hours seemed to be the order of the day. no way was world traveller plus worth the extra money.,Solo Leisure,First Class,Unknown,,no,Unknown
British Airways customer review,6,G Mann,2014-06-25,have flown with ba several times over past few years mostly economy class on holiday through travel agents. aircraft's vary from a bit shabby with little space to sometimes a bit bigger and newer with a bit more space. staff always efficient and polite. the one main flaw is the snack food offering - those awful wraps which are like uncooked cold cardboard. we don't need a 3 course hot meal but eg a granary bread sandwich [with a veggie filling for us] would be preferable to the dreaded wraps which we do not eat which seems such a waste.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Unknown,,yes,Unknown

British Airways customer review,5,Ian Robinson,2014-06-16,paphos - lgw 11th june. we had monitored the outbound flight on the internet so we knew it was about an hour late although we did not receive a text from ba to confirm this. we arrived at paphos airport to a somewhat chaotic scene as the queue for security was snaking back around the complete length of the check in area and ultimately merging with the passengers looking for and waiting to check in with a number of different airlines. ba had 3 check in counters open one of which was for club europe with around eight couples queuing for each one. we had checked in online but still had to drop the cases off and receive our boarding passes and this took approx 20 minutes. i then asked where the fast track through security was what a stupid question that was as as there wasn't one. after 45 minutes in the queue we finally made it to the shared lounge and settled down to a glass of wine or two. the food options were ok but again not a great choice for veggies. the flight home left around 45 minutes late and was fairly uneventful with a relaxed cabin crew. we were off the plane quickly but then had to wait for around 45 minutes for the cases to arrive on the carousel although fortunately ours soon came through. overall just an ok flight but ba's premier european product is somewhat underwhelming.,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Unknown,,yes,Unknown
British Airways customer review,7,R Thompson,2014-06-12,flew world traveller plus for the first time. our trip was to and from lhr from toronto yyz. when flying a distance world traveller plus is well worth the little extra. being a big guy - tall - i really appreciated the larger seats and the extra leg room. and the on-board staff were super. will never fly regular economy again if at all possible. unfortunately we got caught in the baggage screw-up at heathrow on friday june 6th. we made it back to toronto ok but our luggage was just delivered to our house today wednesday june 11th. i guess that one must remain philosophical when these things happen. i'm just glad that it was at the end of our vacation and not the start. all-in-all i will definitely fly british airways again.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Unknown,,no,Unknown

British Airways customer review,1,Kathleen Osborne,2014-05-12,i should be in a nice hotel in romania instead 9 hours after i arrived in heathrow courtesy of british airways i am still in heathrow heading back to glasgow! the 7am flight went well 10/10 for getting me from glasgow to london. the connecting flight to bucharest was delayed by more than an hour which meant i wouldn't get my connecting flight to timisoara. i duly went to customer services (waited 50 mins) who offered to get me to timisoara tomorrow about 3pm as the last flight on 9/5/14 was fully booked. they offered to put me up in a hotel in bucharest but were not able to book one. having waited 50 mins at a ba desk where apparently there was nothing they could do to check availability of a hotel in bucharest i was not filled with confidence. since i was going out for only 48 hours and would miss a large part of my meeting i decided to go back to glasgow. i was booked on the 15.50 to glasgow and given a slip of paper with all the details and told to go to the gate when it was called as they would know all about the booking as it was on the computer. told my boarding pass was sorted. they hadn't sorted it and i got a lecture about what i needed to do in future. there was no way i was getting on the flight told that i should be grateful as they were doing me a favour putting me on the 6.50pm flight. told to go back to the service desk and wait in the queue again!,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Unknown,,yes,Unknown

British Airways customer review,10,A Hickling,2014-05-04,travelled to hkg on board the new a380. boarding was efficient with a dedicated air bridge for first passengers. welcomed on board offered champagne newspaper pyjamas and wash bag and settled into my suite. the space is more noticeable than a 747 or 777 equivalent with a wardrobe that can fit carry on baggage a jacket and shoes plus a side bin that accommodates other items. the food was excellent with the choice of a five course taster menu with accompanying wines or a la carte. there are also treats available in the first galley. breakfast was also very good. i managed to get plenty of sleep as the aircraft is very quiet and walked around the entire plane to get a sense of scale. the crew were excellent addressed me by name engaged in conversation whilst delivering an unobtrusive service. the entertainment system was the thales product. plenty of choice interactive screens and no rebooting as is the case on other long haul aircraft. i couldn't fault this flight just a pity i couldn't spend longer on it. looking forward to the return journey.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Unknown,,no,Unknown
British Airways customer review,1,J Robertson,2012-08-29,"this was a bmi regional operated flight on a rj145 from manchester to heathrow - but with a ba flight number so i have to report it on here. on boarding the cabin crew member didn't look up to check our boarding passes or welcome us. no check on seatbelts etc. prior to takeoff. the service started soon after takeoff since this was a very short flight this consisted of a trolley with drinks and snacks - as is usual on ba domestic services. there were 5 men in front of me returning from a weekend break who were given 2 gin and tonics each and the cabin steward was very friendly with them. he got to me and stared i stared back i took it he had forgotten to say ""may i offer you something from the bar"" or something similar. i asked for an orange juice and that is exactly what was thrust onto my tray. i asked for ice i got one lump splashed into my juice reluctantly. none of the rest of us were offered a further drink but then we didn't expect it on such a short flight. no goodbye to most on departure just a grimace - but that didn't surprise me. it is sad to see that the bmi staff have lost all sense of pride in their jobs.",Solo Leisure,First Class,Unknown,,no,Unknown
